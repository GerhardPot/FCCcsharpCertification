# FCCcsharpCertification
This is where I will do the freeCodeCamp and Microsoft C# Certification

This course uses an online .NET Editor, but this repo is simply a place to store all code challenges and not exercises.

This was originally done on a Windows 11 laptop, running Visual Studio. However, following these instructions (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/.NET), I can even create MVC with EF on VS Code, on Manjaro Linux.
