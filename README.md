# FCCcsharpCertification
This is where I will do the freeCodeCamp and Microsoft C# Certification

This was originally done on a Windows 11 laptop, running Visual Studio. However, following these instructions (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/.NET), I can even create MVC with EF on VS Code, on Manjaro Linux.

# Important to note
I started doing coding challenges on beecrowd, thus expanding my knowledge and experience. From Course 3 and onwards, I will only create programs to help me understand a concept of something, instead of doing every coding challenge and excersice.
